I developed a podcast-style recruitment video for a Yale School of Public Health study on LGBTQ+ mental health, translating research goals into an engaging, accessible format designed to build trust with communities historically underrepresented in research.

## Approach

- Wrote script and narrative framing centering LGBTQ+ community as partners in shaping research
- Demystified participation by clearly explaining study procedures and expectations
- Used warm, conversational language that respected audience intelligence while remaining inviting
- Designed messaging that acknowledged historical research harms while demonstrating commitment to ethical practice

## Results

The video serves as both a functional recruitment tool and a model for community-centered research communication. This approach demonstrates that reaching LGBTQ+ communities requires meeting them where they are with messaging that honors their experiences and invites genuine partnership.
