I wrote the script for a podcast-style recruitment video for the EQuIP study, an NIH-funded clinical trial led by Dr. John Pachankis at the Yale LGBTQ+ Mental Health Initiative. The goal was to translate research goals into an engaging, accessible format that could build trust with LGBTQ+ communities historically underrepresented in mental health research.

## Approach

- Wrote script and narrative framing centering LGBTQ+ community as partners in shaping research
- Demystified participation by clearly explaining study procedures and expectations
- Used warm, conversational language that respected audience intelligence while remaining inviting
- Designed messaging that acknowledged historical research harms while demonstrating commitment to ethical practice

## Results

After the video launched, we saw a nationwide uptick in interest in the Yale LGBTQ+ Mental Health Initiative and the EQuIP study specifically. Hundreds of individuals engaged with our research through the video, and we successfully saw an increase in study enrollment. The project demonstrated that meeting LGBTQ+ communities where they are—with messaging that honors their experiences—can overcome traditional barriers to research participation.
