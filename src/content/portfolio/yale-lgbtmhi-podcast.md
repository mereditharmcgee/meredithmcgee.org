Recruiting LGBTQ+ participants for mental health research requires more than sharing information. It requires building trust. Given historical harms, many LGBTQ+ individuals have valid reasons to be cautious about research participation. The approach needed to be transparent, respectful, and genuinely inviting.

## The Concept

I developed the script and narrative framing for a podcast-style recruitment video that centered community (framing the study as an opportunity for LGBTQ+ voices to shape research), demystified participation (clearly explaining what was involved), and used warm, conversational language that respected audience intelligence.

## Research Communication Done Right

The video demonstrates that reaching communities means meeting them where they are, with messaging that honors their experiences and invites genuine partnership. It's both a functional recruitment tool and an example of how research communication can be done with care and intention.
