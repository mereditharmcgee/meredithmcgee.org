## Overview

This podcast-style recruitment video was created for a Yale School of Public Health study focused on LGBTQ+ mental health. The goal was to translate research objectives into accessible, engaging content that would resonate with potential participants and build trust with a community that has historically been underrepresented in health research.

## The Challenge

Recruiting participants for research studies, especially within marginalized communities, requires more than just sharing information. It requires building trust. LGBTQ+ individuals often have valid reasons to be cautious about participating in research, given historical harms. The recruitment approach needed to be transparent, respectful, and genuinely inviting.

## My Approach

I developed the script and narrative framing for a podcast-style video that:

- **Centered community**: Framed the study as an opportunity for LGBTQ+ voices to shape mental health research
- **Demystified participation**: Clearly explained what the study involved and what participants could expect
- **Built trust**: Used warm, conversational language that respected audience intelligence while remaining accessible
- **Honored lived experience**: Acknowledged the importance of LGBTQ+ perspectives in advancing mental health understanding

## Impact

The video serves as both a recruitment tool and an example of how research communication can be done with care and intention. It demonstrates that reaching communities requires meeting them where they are, with messaging that respects their experiences and invites genuine partnership in the research process.
