## Overview

This research examined the marketing and regulatory oversight of hemp-derived THC products, a rapidly growing market that exists in a regulatory gray area following the 2018 Farm Bill.

## The Challenge

Hemp-derived THC products have proliferated with minimal oversight, raising concerns about marketing practices, product safety, and consumer protection—particularly for vulnerable populations.

## My Approach

I analyzed:

- Marketing practices across hemp-derived THC product categories
- Current regulatory frameworks and enforcement gaps
- Public health implications of inadequate oversight
- Policy recommendations for improved consumer protection

## Impact

Presented this original research at the 2024 American Public Health Association Annual Meeting, contributing evidence to ongoing policy discussions about cannabis regulation and public health protection.
