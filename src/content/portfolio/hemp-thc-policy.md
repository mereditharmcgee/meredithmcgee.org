At the 2024 APHA Annual Meeting, I presented research examining the marketing of hemp-derived THC products advertised as "federally legal" and "mail-order" cannabis under the 2018 Farm Bill loophole. The study analyzed online advertising strategies, consumer-targeted health information, and gaps in regulatory oversight.

## Analysis

I examined marketing practices across hemp-derived THC product categories, documenting how products containing intoxicating cannabinoids are positioned to consumers. The research mapped current regulatory frameworks and enforcement gaps, assessing public health implications of inadequate oversight.

## Significance

Findings highlighted potential consumer misinformation, public health risks, and the evolving legal landscape of hemp-derived cannabinoids. This research contributes to ongoing policy discussions regarding cannabis regulation, harm reduction, and informed consumer decision-making.
