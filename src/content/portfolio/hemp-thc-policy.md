At the 2024 APHA Annual Meeting, I presented research with Chess Blacklock evaluating the marketing practices and health information provided by companies selling hemp-derived THC products. The 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp (<0.3% THC by weight), allowing interstate sales even where cannabis is illegal, yet these products remain largely exempt from packaging and advertising restrictions that apply to state-legal cannabis.

## Methods

We used Google search to identify U.S.-based companies selling hemp-derived THC products and collected data from 30 companies on product types, THC concentrations, shipping availability, legal claims, and lab testing. We applied the DISCERN tool to assess the quality of available health information on each company's website.

## Key Findings

- 40% of products contained other active substances (L-theanine, melatonin, caffeine, B vitamins)
- 70% clearly labeled whether products contained Delta-8 vs Delta-9 THC
- Only 67% had an age gate on their website
- Quality of Information scores were consistently lower than Reliability scores, indicating a need for better external sources and additional consumer information
- Lowest scores related to presentation of alternative products and sharing of sources

## Significance

Findings highlight gaps in consumer protection and health information quality in the hemp-derived THC market. This research contributes to ongoing policy discussions about regulating intoxicating cannabinoids sold outside state cannabis frameworks.
