The 2018 Farm Bill created a regulatory gray area, and the hemp-derived THC market rushed to fill it. Products containing intoxicating cannabinoids now sit on shelves with minimal oversight, raising serious questions about marketing practices, product safety, and consumer protection.

## The Analysis

I examined marketing practices across hemp-derived THC product categories, mapped current regulatory frameworks and enforcement gaps, and assessed public health implications of inadequate oversight. The goal: provide evidence that can inform smarter policy responses.

## The Presentation

I presented this original research at the 2024 American Public Health Association Annual Meeting, contributing to national conversations about how cannabis regulation needs to evolve to protect consumers while enabling legitimate markets.
