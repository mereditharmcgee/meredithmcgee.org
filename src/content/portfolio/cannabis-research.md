My MPH thesis addresses a gap in the research: how do cannabis use patterns differ across sexual identity groups? As legalization expands, understanding these differences is essential for public health messaging that actually reaches all communities.

## The Research

Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from multiple states, I analyzed prevalence, frequency, and consumption modality (smoking, edibles, etc.) by sexual identity. The analysis controls for demographic and geographic factors to isolate meaningful differences.

## Why It Matters

LGBTQ+ populations are often underrepresented or aggregated in substance use research, limiting our ability to develop targeted interventions. This work contributes to a more nuanced evidence base that can inform culturally responsive public health approaches to cannabis education and harm reduction.
