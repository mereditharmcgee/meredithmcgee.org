For my MPH thesis, I conducted quantitative research examining cannabis use patterns across sexual identity groups using multi-state Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. The study analyzed prevalence, frequency, and consumption modality differences, controlling for demographic and geographic factors.

## Methods

Using R for statistical analysis, I examined how cannabis use behaviors vary by sexual identity, including differences in consumption methods (smoking, edibles, vaping) and frequency of use. The analysis draws on a dataset of over 200,000 respondents across multiple states with cannabis-related BRFSS modules.

## Significance

LGBTQ+ populations are often underrepresented or aggregated in substance use research, creating gaps in our ability to develop targeted interventions. This research contributes to a more nuanced evidence base, providing insights that can inform culturally responsive public health approaches to cannabis education and harm reduction.
