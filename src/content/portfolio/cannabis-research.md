## Overview

My MPH thesis examined cannabis use patterns across sexual identity groups, analyzing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to understand differences in prevalence, frequency, and consumption methods.

## The Challenge

While cannabis legalization continues to expand, research on how use patterns vary by sexual identity remains limited. Understanding these differences is essential for developing effective public health messaging and interventions that reach all communities.

## My Approach

Using multi-state BRFSS data, I conducted quantitative analyses examining:

- Prevalence of cannabis use across sexual identity groups
- Frequency of use patterns
- Modality preferences (smoking, edibles, etc.)
- Demographic and geographic variations

## Impact

This research contributes to the growing evidence base on LGBTQ+ health behaviors, providing insights that can inform more targeted and effective public health approaches to cannabis education and harm reduction.
