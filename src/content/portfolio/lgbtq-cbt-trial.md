Recruiting LGBTQ+ participants for mental health research means overcoming historical mistrust and meeting people where they are. For this NIH-funded clinical trial testing LGBTQ+ affirmative CBT, I developed and executed a multi-channel outreach strategy that prioritized authenticity and accessibility.

## The Strategy

- **Podcast appearances** on LGBTQ+-focused shows generated 50+ direct inquiries by explaining the research in conversational, trustworthy contexts
- **Social media content** translated clinical concepts into inviting, clear messaging
- **Community partnerships** extended our reach through organizations already trusted by potential participants
- **Real-time tracking** allowed us to evaluate what worked and adjust strategies accordingly

## The Result

The approach enrolled over 100 participants and demonstrated that thoughtful, community-centered outreach can overcome traditional barriers to research participation. The podcast strategy in particular proved that meeting people in spaces they already occupy is more effective than expecting them to find you.
