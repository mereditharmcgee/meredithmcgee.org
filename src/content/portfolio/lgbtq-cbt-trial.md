## Overview

As a Graduate Research Assistant with the Yale LGBTQ Mental Health Initiative, I developed and executed recruitment strategies for an NIH-funded clinical trial testing LGBTQ+ affirmative cognitive behavioral therapy.

## The Challenge

Mental health research with LGBTQ+ populations requires overcoming historical mistrust of research institutions and reaching diverse community members through channels they trust and engage with.

## My Approach

I created a comprehensive outreach strategy that included:

- **Podcast Campaign**: Secured appearances on LGBTQ+-focused podcasts, generating over 50 direct participant inquiries
- **Digital Outreach**: Developed social media content that translated research concepts into accessible, inviting messaging
- **Community Partnerships**: Built relationships with LGBTQ+ organizations to extend reach through trusted networks
- **Data Systems**: Managed tracking systems to evaluate campaign effectiveness and adjust strategies in real-time

## Impact

The multi-channel approach successfully enrolled over 100 participants, demonstrating that thoughtful, community-centered outreach can overcome traditional barriers to research participation.
