I developed and executed a multi-channel recruitment strategy for an NIH-funded clinical trial testing LGBTQ+ affirmative cognitive behavioral therapy at the Yale LGBTQ Mental Health Initiative. The approach prioritized authentic, community-centered outreach to build trust with populations historically underrepresented in research.

## Strategy

- Secured appearances on LGBTQ+-focused podcasts, generating 50+ direct participant inquiries
- Developed social media content translating clinical concepts into accessible, inviting messaging
- Built partnerships with LGBTQ+ organizations to extend reach through trusted community networks
- Managed tracking systems to evaluate campaign effectiveness and adjust strategies in real-time

## Results

The multi-channel approach successfully enrolled over 100 participants in the clinical trial. Findings demonstrated that thoughtful, community-centered outreach can overcome traditional barriers to research participation, with podcast appearances proving particularly effective for reaching LGBTQ+ audiences in spaces they already trust.
