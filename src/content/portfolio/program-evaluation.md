## Overview

As an Applied Practice Experience Evaluation Specialist at Yale's Office of Public Health Practice, I led comprehensive evaluations of public health internship programs.

## The Challenge

Understanding how students experience practicum placements—and how those experiences translate to professional development—requires systematic evaluation that captures both quantitative outcomes and qualitative experiences.

## My Approach

I conducted full-cycle program evaluations including:

- **Study Design**: Developing evaluation frameworks aligned with program goals
- **Data Collection**: Conducting stakeholder interviews and focus groups with students, supervisors, and program staff
- **Analysis**: Synthesizing qualitative and quantitative data to identify patterns and insights
- **Reporting**: Translating findings into actionable recommendations for program leadership

## Impact

The evaluation work produced concrete recommendations that informed program improvements, demonstrating how rigorous assessment can strengthen public health education and training.
