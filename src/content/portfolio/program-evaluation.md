I conducted an evaluation of the Applied Practice Experience program at Yale's Office of Public Health Practice to assess its effectiveness in fostering meaningful student learning and community engagement. Through qualitative interviews with student fellows and community hosts, I identified key successes, challenges, and opportunities for program improvement.

## Methods

- Designed evaluation frameworks aligned with program learning objectives
- Conducted stakeholder interviews and focus groups with students and supervisors
- Synthesized qualitative and quantitative data to identify patterns and insights
- Compiled findings into a formal report with actionable recommendations

## Results

The evaluation produced concrete recommendations that informed strategic program improvements, ensuring stronger alignment with community needs and student development goals. This project demonstrated how rigorous assessment can strengthen public health education when findings are communicated clearly enough to act on.
