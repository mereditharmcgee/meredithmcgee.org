Good programs need good evaluation. At Yale's Office of Public Health Practice, I led comprehensive assessments of public health internship programs to understand how students experience practicum placements and how those experiences translate to professional development.

## The Process

I handled the full evaluation cycle: designing frameworks aligned with program goals, conducting stakeholder interviews and focus groups with students and supervisors, synthesizing qualitative and quantitative data, and translating findings into actionable recommendations for program leadership.

## Making It Useful

The point of evaluation is improvement, not just measurement. The work produced concrete recommendations that informed real program changes, demonstrating how rigorous assessment can strengthen public health education when findings are communicated clearly enough to act on.
