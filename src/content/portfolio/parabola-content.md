## Overview

As a Public Health Research Fellow and Parabola Leader, I develop educational content that makes cannabis policy research accessible to diverse audiences.

## The Challenge

Academic research on cannabis policy often remains siloed in journals and conferences, failing to reach the policymakers, advocates, and community members who could use it to inform decisions.

## My Approach

I developed a multi-format content strategy including:

- **Research Reports**: Translating findings into clear, actionable briefs
- **Webinars**: Designing and facilitating conversations that bring researchers and practitioners together
- **Social Media**: Creating engaging content that introduces complex topics to broader audiences
- **Partnerships**: Building relationships with organizations and experts to expand reach and credibility

## Impact

This work has helped Parabola Center establish itself as a trusted source for cannabis policy education, connecting rigorous research to the conversations and decisions that shape public health outcomes.
