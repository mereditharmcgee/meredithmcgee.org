I develop educational content at the Parabola Center that translates complex cannabis policy research into accessible formats for policymakers, advocates, and community members. This work bridges the gap between academic research and the stakeholders who can act on it.

## Approach

- Produce research briefs synthesizing findings into actionable language for policy audiences
- Coordinate webinars connecting researchers, practitioners, and community advocates
- Create social media content introducing complex cannabis policy topics to broader audiences
- Build partnerships with organizations and subject matter experts to expand reach and credibility

## Results

Content strategy has helped establish Parabola Center as a trusted resource for cannabis policy education. By connecting rigorous research to real policy conversations, this work ensures findings reach decision-makers positioned to shape public health outcomes.
