Cannabis policy research too often stays trapped in journals and conferences, never reaching the policymakers, advocates, and community members who could actually use it. As a Research Fellow and Parabola Leader, I develop content that bridges that gap.

## The Strategy

I create multi-format content tailored to different audiences: research briefs that translate findings into actionable language, webinars that bring researchers and practitioners into conversation, and social media content that introduces complex topics to broader audiences. I also build partnerships with organizations and experts to expand reach and credibility.

## Building Trust

This work has helped establish Parabola Center as a trusted source for cannabis policy education. Good content isn't just about simplifying information; it's about connecting rigorous research to the real conversations and decisions that shape public health outcomes.
