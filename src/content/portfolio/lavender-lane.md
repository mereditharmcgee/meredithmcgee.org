## Overview

Lavender Lane represents one of the projects I'm most proud of from my undergraduate years—working to establish Lafayette College's first gender-affirming and gender-neutral housing option for LGBTQ+ students.

## The Challenge

Traditional dormitory housing assignments often failed to account for the needs of transgender, non-binary, and other LGBTQ+ students. This created environments where students couldn't fully be themselves, impacting mental health, academic performance, and sense of belonging on campus.

## My Approach

I worked collaboratively with students, staff, and administrators to:

- Document the need for gender-affirming housing through student testimonies and research
- Develop a proposal that addressed practical and policy concerns
- Advocate through official channels while building grassroots support
- Help design implementation guidelines that would make the space welcoming and sustainable

## Impact

Lavender Lane opened as Lafayette's first gender-neutral housing option, providing a space where LGBTQ+ students could live authentically. The initiative created lasting institutional change that continues to support students today, demonstrating how community advocacy can reshape institutional structures.
