This is one of the projects I'm most proud of. Traditional dorm assignments often fail transgender, non-binary, and other LGBTQ+ students, creating environments where people can't fully be themselves. That affects everything: mental health, academics, sense of belonging.

## Building the Case

Working with students, staff, and administrators, I helped document the need through testimonies and research, developed a proposal addressing practical and policy concerns, advocated through official channels while building grassroots support, and designed implementation guidelines to make the space welcoming and sustainable.

## Lasting Change

Lavender Lane opened as Lafayette's first gender-neutral housing option. It still exists today, which is the point: this wasn't about a single cohort of students, but about changing the institution itself. The project showed me how community advocacy can reshape structures that weren't built with everyone in mind.
