At Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center, I built and manage the organization's grant portfolio from the ground up. What started as a modest foundation funding base has grown into a diversified $1M+ portfolio supporting health education, community programs, and capacity building across the Lehigh Valley's LGBTQ+ community.

## What I Do

I handle the full grant lifecycle: prospect research to identify aligned funders, relationship cultivation through site visits and ongoing communication, proposal development that connects community needs to funder priorities, and stewardship reporting that demonstrates impact and builds long-term partnerships.

## Key Wins

- Secured first-time funding from multiple regional and national foundations
- Converted several one-time grants into multi-year commitments
- Built sustainable funding pipelines for core programs including health education and community wellness
- Developed internal systems for grant tracking, deadline management, and impact reporting
