## Overview

At Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center, I built and managed a diversified grant portfolio that has secured over $1 million in foundation and corporate support. This work involved strategic prospecting, relationship cultivation, and developing tailored proposals that align organizational needs with funder priorities.

## The Challenge

The center needed to diversify its funding sources and establish sustainable revenue streams to support expanding programs serving the LGBTQ+ community across the Lehigh Valley. This required building a systematic approach to grant seeking while maintaining authentic relationships with funders.

## My Approach

I developed a full-cycle grant management process that included:

- **Prospect Research**: Identifying foundations and corporate funders whose priorities aligned with our mission
- **Relationship Building**: Cultivating long-term partnerships through consistent communication, site visits, and impact updates
- **Proposal Development**: Crafting compelling narratives that connected community needs to fundable initiatives
- **Compliance & Reporting**: Ensuring all grant requirements were met and outcomes clearly communicated

## Impact

This systematic approach resulted in securing over $1 million in competitive grants, with many funders becoming multi-year supporters. The diversified portfolio has provided stable funding for health education, community programs, and capacity building initiatives.
