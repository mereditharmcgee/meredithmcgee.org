I built and manage a diversified grant portfolio at Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center, securing over $1 million in foundation and corporate support for health education, community programs, and capacity building initiatives serving the Lehigh Valley's LGBTQ+ community.

## Approach

I handle the full grant lifecycle: conducting prospect research to identify aligned funders, cultivating relationships through site visits and ongoing communication, developing tailored proposals that connect community needs to funder priorities, and producing stewardship reports that demonstrate impact and strengthen long-term partnerships.

## Results

- Secured first-time funding from multiple regional and national foundations
- Converted one-time grants into multi-year commitments through strategic relationship building
- Built sustainable funding pipelines for core programs including health education and community wellness
- Developed internal systems for grant tracking, deadline management, and impact reporting
