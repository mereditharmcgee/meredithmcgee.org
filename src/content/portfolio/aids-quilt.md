For many college students, the AIDS crisis feels like distant history. But it's a defining moment in LGBTQ+ community experience, and that disconnect limits understanding of health advocacy, community resilience, and the ongoing impact of HIV/AIDS.

## Making History Present

I coordinated with the National AIDS Memorial to bring quilt panels to campus for the first time in three decades. Beyond logistics, I developed educational programming to contextualize the exhibition and create opportunities for intergenerational dialogue.

## Why It Mattered

The exhibition brought LGBTQ+ history into physical space, creating powerful moments of reflection and connection. It demonstrated how making the past tangible can deepen understanding of present-day health advocacy and community care.
