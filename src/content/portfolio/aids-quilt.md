## Overview

I helped bring panels of the National AIDS Memorial Quilt to Lafayette College's campus for the first time in three decades, creating an opportunity for education, reflection, and connection to LGBTQ+ history.

## The Challenge

For many college students, the AIDS crisis feels like distant history rather than a defining moment in LGBTQ+ community experience. This disconnect limits understanding of health advocacy, community resilience, and the ongoing impact of HIV/AIDS.

## My Approach

Working with campus partners, I:

- Coordinated with the National AIDS Memorial to secure quilt panels
- Developed educational programming to contextualize the exhibition
- Created opportunities for intergenerational dialogue
- Connected historical reflection to present-day advocacy

## Impact

The exhibition brought LGBTQ+ history into physical space on campus, creating powerful moments of reflection and education. It demonstrated how connecting past and present can deepen understanding of community health and advocacy.
