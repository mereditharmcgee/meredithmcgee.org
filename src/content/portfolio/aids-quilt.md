I coordinated with the National AIDS Memorial to bring panels of the AIDS Memorial Quilt to Lafayette College for the first time in three decades. The exhibition created opportunities for education, reflection, and connection to LGBTQ+ history for students often disconnected from this defining moment in community experience.

## Approach

- Coordinated logistics with the National AIDS Memorial to secure quilt panels
- Developed educational programming to contextualize the exhibition for campus audiences
- Created opportunities for intergenerational dialogue connecting historical reflection to present-day advocacy
- Partnered with campus organizations to extend reach and engagement

## Significance

The exhibition brought LGBTQ+ history into physical space on campus, fostering reflection on health advocacy, community resilience, and the ongoing impact of HIV/AIDS. This project highlighted the importance of documenting and sharing LGBTQ+ history to inform present-day understanding and action.
